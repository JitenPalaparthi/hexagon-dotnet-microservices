# üß± The Twelve-Factor App ‚Äî Explained

> A methodology for building **scalable, maintainable, and cloud-native** software as a service (SaaS).

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Codebase ‚Äî *One Codebase, One App*
- **Rule:** One codebase tracked in version control (e.g., Git) with multiple deploys (dev, staging, prod).  
- **Why:** Keeps environments consistent and traceable.  
- **Example:**  
  ```
  myapp/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
  ```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dependencies ‚Äî *Explicitly Declare and Isolate*
- **Rule:** Never rely on system-wide packages; list all dependencies explicitly.  
- **Why:** Ensures repeatable builds and environment consistency.  
- **Example:**  
  - .NET ‚Üí `*.csproj` lists `<PackageReference>`.  
  - Node.js ‚Üí `package.json`.  
  - Python ‚Üí `requirements.txt`.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Config ‚Äî *Store Config in the Environment*
- **Rule:** Configuration (DB strings, API keys, credentials) should be externalized via environment variables, **not** hardcoded.  
- **Why:** Same code ‚Üí different config per environment.  
- **Example:**  
  ```bash
  export DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@host/db"
  export CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR="http://consul:8500"
  ```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Backing Services ‚Äî *Treat as Attached Resources*
- **Rule:** Databases, message queues, caches, etc., are external resources that can be swapped without code changes.  
- **Why:** Enables scaling, portability, and resilience.  
- **Example:** Switch from local Postgres to managed RDS by just changing the connection string.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Build, Release, Run ‚Äî *Strict Separation*
- **Rule:** Separate stages:  
  1. **Build** (compile code)  
  2. **Release** (combine build + config)  
  3. **Run** (execute in environment)  
- **Why:** Guarantees immutability and repeatability.  
- **Example:**  
  ```bash
  docker build -t myapp:v1 .
  docker run -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production myapp:v1
  ```

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Processes ‚Äî *Execute the App as One or More Stateless Processes*
- **Rule:** App instances are **stateless**; any state should go to backing services (DB, cache, etc.).  
- **Why:** Enables horizontal scaling and resilience.  
- **Example:**  
  - OK: Store session data in Redis.  
  - ‚ùå Bad: Store sessions in local memory.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Port Binding ‚Äî *Export Services via Port Binding*
- **Rule:** The app should be self-contained and expose HTTP (or similar) via a port.  
- **Why:** No need for external web servers (e.g., Apache).  
- **Example:**  
  ```bash
  ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:8080
  dotnet run
  ```
  The app now listens on port 8080 directly.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Concurrency ‚Äî *Scale Out via Process Model*
- **Rule:** Scale horizontally (by adding processes/containers), not vertically (by adding threads).  
- **Why:** Enables elastic scaling.  
- **Example:**  
  ```bash
  docker compose up --scale web=4
  ```

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Disposability ‚Äî *Fast Startup and Graceful Shutdown*
- **Rule:** Processes start and stop quickly and handle signals cleanly.  
- **Why:** Enables rolling updates, graceful deploys, and resilience.  
- **Example:**  
  - Handle `SIGTERM` in .NET with `IHostApplicationLifetime`.  
  - Use readiness/liveness probes in Kubernetes.

---

## üîü Dev/Prod Parity ‚Äî *Keep Environments as Similar as Possible*
- **Rule:** Minimize the gap between development, staging, and production.  
- **Why:** Avoid "works on my machine" issues.  
- **Example:**  
  - Use Docker Compose locally that mirrors prod images.  
  - Same Consul/Redis/Postgres versions across environments.

---

## 11Ô∏è‚É£ Logs ‚Äî *Treat Logs as Event Streams*
- **Rule:** The app should write logs to `stdout/stderr`. Aggregation happens externally.  
- **Why:** Lets platforms (Docker, Kubernetes, ELK) handle storage, rotation, and viewing.  
- **Example:**  
  ```csharp
  builder.Logging.AddConsole();
  ```
  Kubernetes or `docker logs` will capture the output.

---

## 12Ô∏è‚É£ Admin Processes ‚Äî *Run Admin Tasks as One-Off Processes*
- **Rule:** One-off tasks (migrations, scripts) should use the same codebase and environment as the app.  
- **Why:** Avoids version drift between admin tools and main app.  
- **Example:**  
  ```bash
  docker compose run orders dotnet ef database update
  ```
